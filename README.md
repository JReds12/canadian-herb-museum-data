# GLANSIS Canadian Herbaria Data Cleaning

**Project Description**:
This project involves cleaning publicly available Canadian Herbarium datasets obtained from GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility). The aim is to fill in spatial gaps in invasive species data within the Great Lakes basin in Canada. The datasets are subset to include only GLANSIS (Great Lakes Aquatic Nonindigenous Species Information System) plant species, both nonindigenous and those on the watchlist, and occurrences within the Great Lakes basin. Entries missing GPS coordinates are supplemented using locality descriptions. Outputs include files containing records of invasive plant species in the Great Lakes, files indicating occurrences where GPS coordinates could not be determined, and files specific to Phragmites australis, a common reed species. of what this project does and who it's for
